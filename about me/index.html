    <h3 align="center" style="color: aliceblue;"> ABOUT ME </h3>

    <h3 style="color: aliceblue;"> A sucker for... </h3>

    <ul>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;"> Freshly baked bread, clean linen sheets, and the warm wet smell of the rain in the heat.
        <br style="color: aliceblue;"> Powdered sugar, faintly sweet. Flaky buttery croissants. Thick dark cups of coffee.
        <br>
        <br style="color: aliceblue;"> Diving into a perfectly temperatured indoor pool, the stinging heat of a warm house after a few hours in the snow (inviting but still biting).
        <br>
        <br style="color: aliceblue;"> TV on low in the background while sleeping next to somebody. The buzz of a periwinkle blue refrigerator light at 3 am.
        <br>
        <br style="color: aliceblue;"> The silver light that floods through sheer curtains just before the sun rises when it seems like the entire world is quiet and revolving around you. Blurry city lights through a wet windshield.
        <br>
        <br style="color: aliceblue;"> Love that looks like skinâ€¦ so close you can see every pore, every freckle, every pimple, every scar. And damn does it look beautiful.
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: aliceblue;"> I find inspireation in... </h3>
        <ul>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">People. Details. Dirty fingernails ripping up napkin corners. 5 year old shoes tapping on a tile floor. Drug use. Drug recovery. First look. Last kiss. Street lights. People who meet as strangers at a party and then sleep together. New cities. Chinese take out. Tattoo stories. Accents. Scars. Shame. Regret. Innocence. The way people fix their own hair. The fuzzy blue-ish lights in dark bathrooms. Teeth. Crooked teeth. Straight teeth. Gritted teeth. Smiles. People.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="color: aliceblue;"> Fun for me means...</h3>
       
        <ul>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;"> Doing something unusual, finding a furious love story, a sudden moment of epiphany, a way to cure my itch for the transcendental.
        <br>
        <br style="color: aliceblue;"> Trying to solve the mysteries of the blood, a way to return to the innocence, the way out of the labyrinth.</p>
        </ul>
